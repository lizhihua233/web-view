# web-view
A HTML document for designer who want to present his(or her) prototype web design.

How to use
It's very easy to use. Just replace the picture "index.jpg".

Notes
Do not change the picture name "index.jpg" and the document suffix ".jpg". If have to, you can use the Notepad to edit the "index.html". Find the 		<img src="index.jpg" width="100%">

And you can change it like this
		<img src="anyname.png" width="100%">
	
	Just Remember the picture name and the picture suffix have to be the same with the <img src="...">
